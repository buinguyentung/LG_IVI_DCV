How poor is Vietnam compared to the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia?
When I visited Hanoi and Saigon, I felt like Jakarta 20 years ago.
In terms of development I think Vietnam's infrastructure and social development is still behind, even to the Philippines.
It doesn't mean that life here is worse than those countries mentioned, for an instance Vietnamese healthier lifestyle and meal gave longer life expectancy than other nations in SEA.
This despite the fact that healthcare there is not as modernized or sophisticated to its more developed neighbors.
Also it appears that Vietnam is still very agricultural in many aspects, the more it have people employed in Service and Industry shows that it is making great progress. 
Vietnam is currently moving forward very fast.

Dear Mr. Kim, Mr. Nghia and Ms. Dung,

My name is Bui Nguyen Tung - Title: Engineer - Department: SD1.
I am hereby confirming the following statements:
1. I am going to leave my position at our DCV right after the expiration date of my 1st labor contract and its attached sign-on bonus.
The period of my current labor contract and Agreement of sign on bonus is from 11st Mar. 2017 to 10th Mar. 2018.
I have decided not to re-new the labor contract with DCV after that.

2. About the retention program
I understand the kindness from DCV's leaders who offered me a generous retention program but I refused. The main reason is that I get a different view on my career path and eager to challenge myself at a new working field. 

3. I am expecting that my last working day is 11st Mar. 2018.
On that day I would have completed the 1st labor contract with respect and without any interruption or compensation.

Besides, I am fully aware that I have the obligation to hand over all my current works to co-workers.
I promise that I will keep working and sharing experience under requirements of my leaders in order to ensure the progress of INFO3.5L project until the last working day.

Thank you all for your enormous supports during the unforgettable time I have been working here.


Yours sincerely,
Bui Nguyen Tung
